   Blind Chess, also known as
Banqi(盲棋), is a two-player Chinese
 board game played on a 4x8 grid.
 Chinese Chess Pieces are used and
 they are ranked as follows:
 (from highest rank to lowest)

		  1p 2p
	King:	  帥  將
	Rook:	  俥  車
	Knight:   傌  馬
	Catapult: 炮  砲
	Retainer: 仕  士
	Minister: 相  象
	Pawn:	  兵  卒

 Higher ranked pieces capture the
 lower ones with the exception of
 Pawn can capture King while King
 can capture any pieces except Pawn. 
 Player One is Red. Player Two is
 Blue. Alternatively, players take
 turns to move a piece, uncover a
 piece, or *capture an opposing
 piece.

 Whoever side captures all the
 other side's pieces, will win.

 Another piece must be captured
within 50 turns before the previous
capture of a piece; otherwise, it's
a draw game.

*Opponent's piece must be uncovered
 in order to be captured.
